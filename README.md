# GanttChart
This is an Excel workbook to create Gantt Charts  
There is an instruction sheet included in the workbook.
## Usage  
Enter your schedule's inputs (Task, Start, Stop, Outline Level) on the Project-Input sheet  
There is a separate sheet for each of 4 views of the input data:  
  * Week  
  * Month  
  * Quarter  
  * Year

The view sheets are locked. Email BriargateExcel@GMail.com for the unlock password.  
There are examples below of the input format, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly views. The same input is used for each picture. The schedule used in the example is not necessarily a workable example. It is designed to demonstrate all the capabilities of the tool.
## Input Example  
The start date is set on the Settings And Help sheet.
